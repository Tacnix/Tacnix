At **Tacnix**, we believe in the power of remote work to enhance flexibility, productivity, and overall employee well-being. Our **remote-first** approach allows our team members to work from any location, promoting a balanced and healthy work-life integration.

## 1. **Work Hours**

Tacnix operates on a flexible schedule. Employees can manage their time, provided they meet the following conditions:

- Core work hours: **10:00 AM to 4:00 PM IST** (for meetings and team collaboration)
- Availability for project deadlines and urgent tasks
- A minimum of 40 hours per week is expected.

Employees are free to manage the rest of their working hours as per their convenience, ensuring optimal performance and productivity.

## 2. **Communication & Collaboration**

We emphasize transparent and efficient communication. Our team collaborates using modern tools to maintain workflow, no matter where we are. Key tools include:

- **Slack** for team messaging and real-time communication
- **Zoom** for meetings and video calls
- **Notion** for task and project management
- **Zoho Mail** for email and document collaboration

Team members are expected to stay active during core hours, respond to messages promptly, and attend scheduled meetings.

## 3. **Equipment & Workspace**

Tacnix does not provide company hardware. Employees are responsible for setting up and maintaining their own devices. We encourage a comfortable, ergonomic workspace for productive remote work. We rely on **open-source** libraries and tools for project execution, which eliminates the need for paid software licenses.

---

## 4. **Performance & Accountability**

Performance is evaluated based on output and results rather than physical presence. Team members are trusted to manage their workload and meet deadlines. Key points include:

- Regular check-ins with team leads or managers
- Weekly or bi-weekly performance reviews
- Milestone-based goals for project progress

---

## 5. **Security & Data Protection**

Tacnix places great importance on data security and confidentiality. All remote employees are expected to follow security protocols, including:

- Use of **VPNs** and secure connections while accessing company resources
- Regular updates of software and antivirus programs
- Compliance with Tacnixâ€™s **confidentiality** and **data protection policies**

---

## 6. **Benefits of Remote Work**

Our remote work policy aims to provide the following benefits:

- **Work-life balance**: Employees have the freedom to manage their schedules in a way that suits their personal and professional lives.
- **Increased productivity**: Without the need for daily commuting, employees can focus on delivering high-quality work.
- **Global talent**: A remote-first approach enables us to attract diverse talent from various regions, enriching our work culture and innovation.

## 7. **Travel & Company Meetups**

While Tacnix is a remote-first company, we value in-person interactions and host occasional team-building retreats and meetups. Attendance is encouraged to foster stronger connections among the team.

---

## 8. **Legal Compliance**

Tacnix ensures compliance with local labor laws and remote work regulations applicable to each employee's location. Employees are encouraged to stay informed about local tax regulations and policies.

---

## 9. **Policy Updates**

This remote work policy is subject to periodic updates to ensure alignment with industry standards and company goals. All updates will be communicated in advance.
